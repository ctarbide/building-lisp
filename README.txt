This is a very interesting and educational lisp implementation, inspired by
[SICP], see [INTRO] for more details. This fork is just a test-case for the
[ICON-RTT] translator, [COOLSCRIPTS] is also required for the build.

I intend to keep rebasing with [BUILDING-LISP], so merge-conflicts are
to be expected.
